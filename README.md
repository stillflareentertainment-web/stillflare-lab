  <em>Current Release: MAAS-HR v0.2 — Pilot</em>
</p>

---

This project hosts live prototypes for the **MAAS engine** and other Stillflare-built systems.  
Think of it as a working studio — where models, UI experiments, and HR-safe consoles evolve in public.

> **Scope & Ethics**
>
> MAAS-HR supports HR and operational awareness.  
> It does **not** evaluate mental health, diagnose individuals, or support clinical decision-making.  
> No PHI or clinical data should ever be entered into the system.

**License:** Stillflare Public Reference License — Source-visible, not for commercial reuse.

## 🧠 Current Prototype — MAAS · HR Risk Containment Model

A slider-based HR console that turns real-world operational patterns into a **clear containment + exposure snapshot**, including:

✔ Schedule variability  
✔ Workload intensity  
✔ Communication pressure  
✔ Notice unpredictability  
✔ Clarity controls  
✔ Process reliability  
✔ Recovery / break compliance  

The model produces a **clean, printable HR-ready summary** that can be dropped directly into an HR packet.

> **MAAS-HR v0.2 — Pilot**  
> Focused on clarity, safety, and real-world usability.

---

## 🧪 Stillflare Research Lab

The **Stillflare Research Lab** develops non-clinical, human-centered models that help organizations understand how work design, scheduling, communication, clarity, and recovery interact to shape operational risk.

### **MAAS-HR — Meta-Awareness Assessment System (HR)**

A visual-analytic framework modeling:

- **Rf — Functioning Risk** (cumulative strain on workers)  
- **Ro — Organizational Risk** (vulnerability created by structure)  
- **C(t) — Containment Strength** (stabilizing effect of structure)  
- **E — Exposure Load** (sustained operational pressure)  

MAAS-HR models **systems — not people.**

It is built for **HR and operations planning only.**

# 🧭 Research Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the project grounded in **ethics, clarity, and scientific rigor** while remaining accessible to everyday HR environments.

### ✅ Phase 1 — Concept Stabilization *(Current — v0.2 Pilot)*

Focus:
- Clarify model structure & language  
- Ensure non-clinical boundaries  
- Build HR-friendly reporting format  
- Transparent documentation  

Deliverables:
- Whitepaper (Working Draft)  
- Public Lab README + Docs  
- Ethics & Scope Statement  
- Model Specification Summary  

---

### 🔄 Phase 2 — Field-Safe Validation *(Planned)*

We will explore **non-surveillance, privacy-respecting observation**, including:

- Qualitative case snapshots  
- Pattern analysis using fictionalized examples  
- HR-only operational metrics  
- Stakeholder interviews (non-medical context)  

Goals:
- Test clarity & usefulness  
- Avoid individual scoring or medical inference  
- Strengthen ethical guardrails  

---

### 🧪 Phase 3 — Simulation & Stress Testing *(Planned)*

Develop structured simulation paths:

- Scenario comparisons  
- Structured “what-if” runs  
- Risk load trajectory modeling  
- Control-lever sensitivity tests  

Outputs:
- Risk behavior curves  
- Containment trajectory patterns  
- Non-clinical operational learning tools  

---

### 📊 Phase 4 — Longitudinal Organizational Study *(Planned)*

If aligned with ethical review + participation:

- Track changes in structure over time  
- Observe workplace-level stabilization trends  
- Maintain strict **no-PHI, no-diagnostics** boundary  
- Publish **system-level learnings only**  

Focus is always on **designing safer systems — not labeling people.**

---

### 🌍 Phase 5 — Academic + Public Dissemination *(Aspirational)*

Possible pathways:

- ORCID registry + research identity  
- Preprint publication  
- Conference presentation  
- Partnerships with workplace research teams  

Core values:

✔ Human-centered  
✔ Transparent  
✔ Non-clinical  
✔ Ethically bounded  
✔ Respectful of workers  

---

## 📚 Planned Supporting Documents

These will live in `/docs/` as the project matures:

- `whitepaper.md` — Working Research Draft  
- `model-spec.md` — Model structure & logic (plain-language)  
- `ethics-and-scope.md` — Responsible use framework  
- `changelog.md` — Version history  
- `bibliography.md` — Research lineage & references

## 🔐 Responsible Use

MAAS-HR supports:

✔ HR strategy  
✔ Schedule planning  
✔ Workload clarity  
✔ Operations dialogue  
✔ Non-clinical risk awareness  

MAAS-HR does **not** support:

✘ Diagnosis  
✘ Clinical treatment  
✘ Mental-health assessment  
✘ Individual scoring or surveillance  

No PHI or medical information should ever be entered.
