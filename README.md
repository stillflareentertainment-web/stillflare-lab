This project hosts live prototypes for the **MAAS engine** and other Stillflare-built systems.  
Think of it as a working studio — where models, UI experiments, and HR-safe consoles evolve in public.

MAAS-HR supports HR and operational awareness.
It does not evaluate mental health, diagnose individuals, or support clinical decision-making.
