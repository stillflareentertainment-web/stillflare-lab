# Ethics & Scope — MAAS-HR  
**Stillflare Research Lab — Working Paper Series**

_Last updated: December 2025_  
_Current model release: MAAS-HR v0.2 — Pilot_

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose & Intended Use

**MAAS-HR (Meta-Awareness Assessment System for Human Resources)** is a **non-clinical, organizational risk-awareness model**.  
It helps HR, operations leaders, and workplace stakeholders reason about how everyday **work design variables** — such as workload intensity, schedule stability, clarity, and recovery — may influence **organizational risk load over time.**

MAAS-HR is designed for:

- HR & Operations planning  
- Policy & scheduling design conversations  
- Workload + communication pattern assessment  
- Organizational health & resilience awareness  
- Ethical decision support around structure and staffing  
- Non-surveillance, **human-centered system design**

MAAS-HR **does not** measure or evaluate individual mental-health states.  
It remains **strictly positioned at the systems level.**

---

## 2️⃣ Model Boundaries — What MAAS-HR Does (and Does Not) Do

### ✅ MAAS-HR **DOES**
- Model **system-level risk load** — not people
- Treat workplace stressors as **organizational variables**
- Focus on **structure, clarity, and recovery**
- Produce interpretable, plain-language reports
- Provide **ethical framing rather than diagnosis**
- Encourage psychologically safe decision-making
- Promote **organizational responsibility** for risk conditions
- Support **non-clinical** workplace dialogue

### ❌ MAAS-HR **DOES NOT**
- Diagnose mental-health conditions  
- Assess an individual’s mental-health state  
- Replace medical, clinical, or psychological tools  
- Provide clinical advice  
- Predict individual outcomes  
- Support disciplinary tracking or surveillance  
- Replace professional judgement  
- Handle or store **Protected Health Information (PHI)**

If a conversation or decision begins to enter a **clinical, diagnostic, or employee medical** space, users should **stop using MAAS-HR immediately** and move to appropriate professional and ethical frameworks.

---

## 3️⃣ Core Ethical Principles

MAAS-HR is grounded in the following ethical guardrails:

### 🧠 1. **Non-Medicalization of Work**
Workplace strain is often **structural, not individual.**  
MAAS-HR refuses to pathologize staff or convert operational risk into medical narratives.

---

### 🛑 2. **Non-Surveillance by Design**
The tool must **never** be used to:
- Track individuals
- Target employees
- Monitor personal performance
- Build risk profiles on staff
- Enforce punitive control

MAAS-HR is a **systems-only lens.**

---

### 🧍 3. **Human-Centered Responsibility**
When risk rises, MAAS-HR points to **organizational drivers and controls**, not “worker resilience.”

People are not “risk liabilities.”  
**Systems are.**

---

### 🔒 4. **Privacy & Safety First**
User implementation must ensure:
- No PHI is collected
- No personal medical interpretation occurs
- No personally identifying employee data is stored or modeled
- HR use remains non-coercive and ethics-aligned

---

### 🕊️ 5. **Compassionate Interpretation**
MAAS-HR encourages **soft language, uncertainty tolerance, and reflective judgement.**  
Outputs must never be used to force compliance or justify harm.

---

### 🧾 6. **Transparency & Explainability**
All model logic should remain:
- Understandable  
- Reviewable  
- Auditable  
- Explainable in plain English  

This ensures **non-manipulative interpretation.**

---

## 4️⃣ Scope Limitation Statement

> **MAAS-HR is an HR / operations awareness model.  
It is not a clinical or diagnostic tool and must not be used for medical decision-making.**

The model evaluates **Risk Load on Systems**, via two interacting dimensions:

- **Rf — Functioning Risk**  
  System-level strain acting on workers

- **Ro — Organizational Risk**  
  Vulnerability created by workload design, schedule stability, clarity, communication, and recovery structure

From these inputs the model derives:

- **C(t) — Containment Strength**
- **E — Exposure Load**

---

## 5️⃣ Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

Users **MAY**:

✔ Analyze scheduling & workload stability  
✔ Plan operational improvements  
✔ Support HR policy conversations  
✔ Evaluate organizational pattern change  
✔ Print reports for non-clinical HR documentation  
✔ Conduct research & field observations  
✔ Use anonymized, non-identifying inputs  

Users **MAY NOT**:

🚫 Perform employee mental-health evaluation  
🚫 Substitute MAAS-HR for health treatment  
🚫 Monitor or profile individuals  
🚫 Attach reports to medical records  
🚫 Use model output for discipline  
🚫 Feed the tool PHI  
🚫 Use the tool in therapy or clinical care  
🚫 Represent the tool as a medical instrument  

Violations materially break the spirit & ethics of Stillflare Research.

---

## 6️⃣ Data & Privacy

The model is designed to run **client-side only.**  
Stillflare does not collect, store, or transmit user data.

Organizations implementing MAAS-HR must:

🔐 Avoid storing identifying records  
🔐 Avoid linking model output to an employee  
🔐 Avoid health-related data entry  
🔐 Provide transparency to staff when MAAS-HR is being used  

Where possible, anonymization should occur at input source.

---

## 7️⃣ Appropriate Language Guidance

When communicating about MAAS-HR outputs:

Use terms like:

> *“Operational exposure load appears elevated.”*  
> *“We may need stronger clarity controls.”*  
> *“Current schedule structure may be increasing system-level risk.”*

Avoid language like:

> *“Employees are unstable.”*  
> *“This person is a risk.”*  
> *“The model proves someone is unfit.”*

---

## 8️⃣ Governance & Future Direction

MAAS-HR remains under **active research development** within Stillflare’s Research Lab.

### Future work includes:

📊 Field validation  
🔁 Longitudinal model refinement  
⚖️ Ethics governance review  
🔍 Independent oversight  
🛠 Deployment best-practice guidance  
🧪 Simulation studies  

Transparency is non-negotiable.
So are **human dignity and worker protection.**

---

## 9️⃣ Final Ethical Commitment

MAAS-HR exists to **reduce harm — not create it.**

It invites organizations to ask:

> “What responsibility does the system hold  
> when people are under pressure?”

And then to **change the system — not the person.**
