Thank you for your interest in Stillflare Lab and the MAAS-HR model.

This project is primarily a **personal R&D lab** for systems, visuals, and HR-safe models.  
Contributions are welcome in the form of **feedback, ideas, and respectful discussion**, but code changes are tightly controlled to protect the integrity and scope of the system.

## Ground Rules

By interacting with this repository (issues, discussions, or pull requests), you agree to:

- Respect the **non-clinical scope** of MAAS-HR
- Avoid sharing any **real-world, personally identifiable, or protected health information (PHI)**
- Keep feedback focused on:
  - clarity,
  - usability,
  - HR/operations practicality,
  - and systems design

This project is **not** a place for:
- clinical advice,
- medical diagnostics,
- or case-specific mental health discussions.

## Code Contributions

At this time, **direct code contributions (pull requests)** are:

- **By invitation only**
- Limited to small, focused changes such as:
  - UI polish
  - accessibility improvements
  - documentation fixes
  - clearly defined feature experiments

If you’d like to propose a code contribution:

1. Open an **Issue** with:
   - a clear description of the change,
   - why it’s useful for HR/operations,
   - and any risks or tradeoffs you see.
2. Wait for confirmation before opening a Pull Request.

Unsolicited PRs may be closed without review to keep the project focused and manageable.

- Bugs or obvious breakage
- Confusing language or unclear flows
- Ideas for HR-friendly reporting, safety, or scope clarity
- Suggestions for:
  - better labels,
  - more helpful guidance,
  - or improved narrative framing

When opening an issue:

- **Do not** include real names, workplaces, or specific incidents.
- Keep examples fictional or abstracted.
- Focus on patterns, not people.

## Scope Clarification

MAAS-HR is designed as an **HR / Operations tool**, not a clinical instrument.

Contributions should support:

- schedule and workload awareness,
- communication and process clarity,
- safe recovery and break planning,
- organizational risk visibility,

and should **not** push the project toward:

- clinical assessment,
- individual diagnosis,
- psychological treatment tools,
- or health-data processing.
